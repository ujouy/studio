# **App Name**: Streetwear AI

## Core Features:

- AI Graphic Generation: Allow users to describe and generate custom streetwear graphics using the Google Generative AI Image API, seeing the generated artwork on-screen and iterating until satisfied. The AI will use a tool to decide when and how to make adjustments.
- Dynamic Product Previews: Render user-generated AI art in real time over product mockups (t-shirts, hoodies, hats).
- User Authentication: Allow user registration (email, Google, social login optional) and secure account dashboard access.
- My Designs Dashboard: User dashboard includes saved designs, order history, and account settings.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#6A49A2) for a high-end and mysterious feel.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#2A282E) for a luxurious streetwear vibe.
- Accent color: Lavender (#D3B2FF) for highlighting key elements and CTAs.
- Body: 'Inter' sans-serif. Headline: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif
- Use a set of minimalist icons to represent product features and user actions.  Keep line weights consistent and the style modern.
- Employ a high-contrast layout with plenty of whitespace to enhance readability and draw focus to the products.
- Use subtle animations for button hover states and transitions between pages to enhance the user experience.
